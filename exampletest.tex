% Uncommenting \keytrue would set the "key" variable to TRUE:
\keytrue

% here's the output file that contains the correct answers, to be read
% later by the python script:
\opentempfile{answerlist.txt}

% Marker for test version "A" or "B"
% \testversionmarker{A}

% More generic upper left label:
\upperleftcomment{(This label could say ``Test Version A'' or ``Good luck, suckers!'', for example)}

% print the header:
\testheader{Example}{Your Class}{Fall \the\year}{0.75in}

% Print the boilerplate instructions:
\printinstructions

% page break:
\newpage

% There aren't sections in this test -- just some number of questions worth 2 points each:
\bigskip\noindent\textbf{~~~~Pick the best answer for each question:} \emph{2 points each.}\bigskip


% Set the question counter to zero, for starters:
\setcounter{saveenum}{0}

% the \input statement here isn't necessary of course, but it's convenient:

% extra credit questions work almost the same as regular multiple choice questions,

\question{Why does Python make life easier?}
\eqq

\printifkey{0.5in}{Because the code is more readable than Perl, even though Perl is easier to write.}


\question{Why does R make life easier?}
\eqq

\printifkey{0.5in}{Acceptable answers include: impressive graphics, 
ability to use it in a cluster environment, \LaTeX{} output tables, 
and forcing users to learn more about the numerical methods they are using.}
